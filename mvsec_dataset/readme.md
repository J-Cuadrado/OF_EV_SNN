To make the codes in this folder work, you will need to create the directory 'files' inside the 'mvsec_dataset' directory, and then create the directories 'raw' and 'saved' inside it.

Please place all unzipped files from the MVSEC dataset on 'files/raw'.

Generated files will be stored in 'files/saved'.
